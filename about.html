        <h2>The Mission</h2>
        <p>
          PGCare exists to make PostgreSQL databases boring. Not boring in a bad way—boring in the best possible way.
          Boring means reliable. Boring means predictable. Boring means you can focus on building your product instead
          of worrying about your database.

        <h2>The Experience</h2>
        <p>
          With over 14 years of hands-on PostgreSQL administration experience, I've worked across diverse production
          environments—from high-growth startups to enterprise systems processing millions of transactions daily.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus areas include:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; color: var(--text-secondary);">
          <li>Backup and disaster recovery strategies</li>
          <li>Database monitoring and alerting systems</li>
          <li>Performance optimization and query tuning</li>
          <li>High availability and replication</li>
          <li>Zero-downtime migrations and upgrades</li>
          <li>Production incident response and troubleshooting</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>A backup that's never been restored isn't a backup.</strong> This principle guides everything I do.
          It's not enough to have systems in place—they need to be tested, documented, and proven to work when it matters most.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; color: var(--text-secondary);">
          <li><strong>Practical over theoretical:</strong> Real-world solutions that work in production</li>
          <li><strong>Testing over assumptions:</strong> Validate everything, especially disaster recovery</li>
          <li><strong>Simplicity over complexity:</strong> The best solution is often the simplest one</li>
          <li><strong>Documentation over tribal knowledge:</strong> Your team should know what to do</li>
          <li><strong>Prevention over firefighting:</strong> Catch issues before they become incidents</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>This Blog</h2>
        <p>
          This site is a collection of practical notes, lessons learned, and insights from working with PostgreSQL
          in production for over a decade. The posts focus on real-world challenges and proven solutions—no fluff,
          no theory for theory's sake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Topics include backup strategies, monitoring best practices, performance optimization, disaster recovery,
          and the operational aspects of running PostgreSQL that don't always make it into the official documentation.
        </p>
